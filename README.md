##  Data-Driven Policing at the MTA

Introduction
With increased vaccination rates throughout NYC and with more workers returning to the in-person workforce, there has unfortunately also been a steep increase in crimes committed within the transit system. 

According to the NYPD, in May, subway crime shot up by 93% compared to May of 2020.  As a response to this, additional police officers will be deployed throughout the 5 boroughs. 

This project intends to analyze MTA turnstile data from May 2021-July 2021 and determine what station entrances and exits would be best suited for the deployment of additional officers. Knowing this information would help with the budgeting of time and resources for the New York Police Department.
